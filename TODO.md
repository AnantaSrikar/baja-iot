## I/O
- [x] I2C with OLED display (ssd1306) - Done! [Docs](https://learn.adafruit.com/micropython-hardware-ssd1306-oled-display/circuitpython)
- [ ] 20 x 4 LCD display

## Communication
- [ ] I2C between devices. [This](https://www.instructables.com/Raspberry-Pi-Pico-With-I2C-Oled-Display-and-Circui/) might help. - Slave I2C not possible on CircuitPython. Need to use C/C++ SDK
- [ ] Label picos with address

## Sensors
- [x] Acceleration sensor read on pico with circuitpython - Done! [Docs](https://docs.circuitpython.org/projects/mpu6050/en/latest/)
- [ ] RPM sensor: How to use + configure for prop shaft
- [ ] Make Engine RPM sensor following [this](https://kokoraskostas.blogspot.com/p/inductive-spark-plug-sensor-engine-rpm.html)
- [ ] GPS sensor: No. of laps, time per lap?
- [ ] Baud rates of: Acceleration sensor, RPM sensor
- [ ] Car speed display using Propshaft RPM
